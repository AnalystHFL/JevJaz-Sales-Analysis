# JevJaz Kids Store-Sales-Analysis

I created a powerful Excel project where I transformed raw sales data into easy-to-understand dashboards and tables for JevJaz Kids Store. Throughout the process, I collected and recorded all important information, made sure everything was neat and accurate, and turned complex numbers into colorful charts that reveal real business stories. This project helps anyone no matter their background see which products are selling best, spot important trends, and make smarter decisions for the future, all with just a look at the visuals.
